# GE-Distance

The ge-distance package builds upon the graph ensemble package, a project by a project by [Leonardo Niccol√≤ Ialongo](https://datasciencephd.eu/students/leonardo-niccol%C3%B2-ialongo/) and [Emiliano Marchese](https://www.imtlucca.it/en/emiliano.marchese/), under the supervision of [Diego Garlaschelli](https://networks.imtlucca.it/people/diego), which contains a set of methods to build fitness based graph ensembles from marginal information.

The graph-ensemble repository can be found at:

## Project Description

This project aims at reproducing a firm-to-firm network for the entire italian country, introducing the distance as a property that influences the construction of such network.

## TODO List

List of the taks envisioned for bringing to completion the project:

[  ] _Introducing the distance as dyadic properties_  
[  ] _Scale the creation of ensemble to the 5mln nodes in the firm-to-firm network._  
[  ]

## Features

The repository contains a module, __distance__, where starting from the locations of the firms, compute the distance matrix among firms, in two steps:

1. Creates a grid depending
